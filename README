GNU Libidn is an implementation of the Stringprep, Nameprep, Punycode
and IDNA specifications, licensed under the LGPL.  See ANNOUNCE for an
overview, and libidn.{info,ps,pdf} for the manual.

Things left to do below.  If you like to start working on anything,
please let me know so work duplication can be avoided.

  - Optimize stringprep, the table searching is slow (but does it matter?).
  - Port applications to use libidn.
  - Include more stringprep profiles.
  - Add IDNA tools
  - Rename package?  Stringprep useful outside of IDN.  Separating
    into libstringprep + libidn was considered, but libidn would
    be so small it would be wasteful to create it.  libunicodenames?

Anticipated Frequently Asked Questions:

Q#1: Why doesn't Libidn use a separate library for the Unicode
     operations?

A#1: Separate libraries (Glib, QT, libiconv) seldom mark the Unicode
     tables with the corresponding Unicode version they implement, nor
     do they provide a interface where a specific version can be
     requested.  This violates the stringprep specification which
     requires that a specific version is used.  Also, some of these
     third party libraries depend on non-portable behavior
     (e.g. threads).

Q#2: Why do Libidn include several stringprep profiles? They waste space!

A#2: The stringprep profiles included are derived from the generic
     stringprep tables, and doesn't waste more than say a few hundred
     bytes (see profiles.c).
