Libidn README -- Important introductory notes.
Copyright (C) 2002, 2003 Simon Josefsson
See the end for copying conditions.

GNU Libidn is a package for internationalized string handling based on
stringprep, punycode and IDNA.  It is licensed under the LGPL.  See
ANNOUNCE for an overview, and libidn.{info,ps,pdf} for the manual.

Things left to do below.  If you like to start working on anything,
please let me know so work duplication can be avoided.

  - Optimize stringprep for speed, the table searching is slow (but
    does it matter?).
  - Optimize for size?  The stringprep tables can be compressed _alot_
    (most map entries are simply zeroes).
  - Port applications to use libidn.
  - Include more stringprep profiles.
  - Improve IDN tool.
