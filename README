Libidn README -- Important introductory notes.
See the end for copying conditions.

GNU Libidn is an implementation of the IETF Stringprep, Nameprep,
Punycode and IDNA specifications, licensed under the LGPL.  See
ANNOUNCE for an overview, and libidn.{info,ps,pdf} for the manual.

Things left to do below.  If you like to start working on anything,
please let me know so work duplication can be avoided.

  - Optimize stringprep, the table searching is slow (but does it matter?).
  - Port applications to use libidn.
  - Include more stringprep profiles.
  - Add texi documentation.
  - Implement IDNA tools?  Is there more?
  - Rename package?  Stringprep useful outside of IDN.  Separating
    into libstringprep + libidn was considered, but libidn would
    be so small it would be wasteful to create it.  libunicodenames?

Before it becomes a FAQ: This library do not link with GLIB for the
UTF-8 functions for two reasons.  First, GLIB does not provide
versioning of the Unicode tables (and the developers said it will not
be added either) and this package must know the Unicode version used.
Secondly, GLIB requires some things (e.g., threads) that would make
this package less portable.
