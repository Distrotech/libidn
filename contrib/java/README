Libidn README -- Notes for the JAVA API proof of concept.

You need GCJ to build this.  It was tested with Sun JDK 1.1 and IBM
JDK 1.1.8 too, after replacing "gcj" with "javac" and "gcjh" with
"javah" in Makefile.am.  Some combinations of compilation with one
package and executing using another package (e.g., compile with GCJ,
run with Sun's JRE) also seemed to work.

$ ./autogen.sh # if building from CVS
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit
$ make ExampleIDNA
$ gij ExampleIDNA räksmörgås

$ 

Please let me know if you want to finish and maintain the Java API
glue.  It may involve some tedious work initially, but could be
interesting in the long run.
