* Version 0.1.6 (released 2003-02-11)

** Uses tentative IDNA ACE prefix.

** Added XMPP Node/Resource Identifiers stringprep profiles.

** Fixed prohibited character checks for bidi.

* Version 0.1.5 (released 2003-01-28)

** The library can now be built as part of GNU Libc.
This is experimental and only tested against GNU Libc version 2.3.1.
See the libc/ directory, and libc/README in particular.

** Bug fixes.

* Version 0.1.4 (released 2003-01-15)

** Documentation fixes.

** Portability fixes.

** Bug fixes.

* Version 0.1.3 (released 2003-01-15)

** Added texinfo manual.

* Version 0.1.2 (released 2003-01-08)

** Added high-level IDNA API.

** Added example3.c and example4.c demonstrating the high-level IDNA API.

* Version 0.1.1 (released 2003-01-08)

** Added documentation using GTK-DOC.

** The obsolete stringprep_utf8_to_ucs4_fast API entry point was removed.
By accident it was never removed in 0.1.0.

* Version 0.1.0 (released 2003-01-05)

** Official GNU project.

** Renamed from libstringprep to libidn.

** Supports punycode and IDNA.  Caveat emptor: I don't use it myself.

** Uses "unsigned long" for Unicode code points instead of "long".
Long is guaranteed to be at least 32 bits by C standards so it is
always sufficiently large, no need to use uint32_t and the like.

** The obsolete stringprep_utf8_to_ucs4_fast API entry point was removed.

* Version 0.0.8 (released 2002-12-13)

** Portability fixes (now works under Cygwin on Windows 2000).

** Bug fixes.

* Version 0.0.7 (released 2002-12-09)

** Apply all tables to entire strings, not just first hit.

** Fix bidi infloop.

* Version 0.0.5 (released 2002-12-07)

** Fix prohibited characters handling.

** Fix bidi.

** Renamed type (struct) stringprep_table_element to Stringprep_table_element.

** Renamed type stringprep_profile to Stringprep_profile.

** Renamed type (struct) stringprep_table to Stringprep_table.

** Added more self-tests.

* Version 0.0.4 (released 2002-12-06)

** Add unassigned code point handling, including self test cases.

** Portability fixes.

* Version 0.0.3 (released 2002-11-30)

** Exported utility function `stringprep_utf8_to_unichar', complementary
to existing `stringprep_unichar_to_utf8'.

** Renamed `stringprep_utf8_to_ucs4_fast' to `stringprep_utf8_to_ucs4' to
clean up API. The old entry point is maintained for binary backwards
compatibility though.

** The distribution is from now on signed using GnuPG.

** Bug fixes.

* Version 0.0.2 (released 2002-11-07)

** NFKC self test.

** Bug fixes.

* Version 0.0.1 (released 2002-11-06)

** Add utility functions stringprep_locale_charset(), stringprep_convert() 
and stringprep_locale_to_utf8 () that can be used to convert text from
system's locale into UTF-8, which should be done before invoking
stringprep().  The functions requires iconv() in the operating system.

** An example program (example.c) that illustrates how libstringprep can be
used is included.

** The pkg-config --libs output should now include necessary -R options.

* Version 0.0.0 (released 2002-11-05)

** Initial release
