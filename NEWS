* Version 0.0.1

** Add utility functions stringprep_locale_charset(), stringprep_convert() 
** and stringprep_locale_to_utf8 () that can be used to convert text from
** system's locale into UTF-8, which should be done before invoking
** stringprep().  The functions requires iconv() in the operating system.

** An example program (example.c) that illustrates how libstringprep can be
** used is included.

** The pkg-config --libs output should now include necessary -R options.

* Version 0.0.0

** Initial release
