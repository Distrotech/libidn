Libidn NEWS -- History of user-visible changes.                 -*- outline -*-
See the end for copying conditions.

* Version 0.1.0

** Supports punycode and IDNA.  Caveat emptor: I don't use it myself.

** Uses "unsigned long" for Unicode code points instead of "long".
Long is guaranteed to be at least 32 bits by C standards so it is
always sufficiently large, no need to use uint32_t and the like.

* Version 0.0.8

** Portability fixes (now works under Cygwin on Windows 2000).

** Bug fixes.

* Version 0.0.7

** Apply all tables to entire strings, not just first hit.

** Fix bidi infloop.

* Version 0.0.5

** Fix prohibited characters handling.

** Fix bidi.

** Renamed type (struct) stringprep_table_element to Stringprep_table_element.

** Renamed type stringprep_profile to Stringprep_profile.

** Renamed type (struct) stringprep_table to Stringprep_table.

** Added more self-tests.

* Version 0.0.4

** Add unassigned code point handling, including self test cases.

** Portability fixes.

* Version 0.0.3

** Exported utility function `stringprep_utf8_to_unichar', complementary
to existing `stringprep_unichar_to_utf8'.

** Renamed `stringprep_utf8_to_ucs4_fast' to `stringprep_utf8_to_ucs4' to
clean up API. The old entry point is maintained for binary backwards
compatibility though.

** The distribution is from now on signed using GnuPG.

** Bug fixes.

* Version 0.0.2

** NFKC self test.

** Bug fixes.

* Version 0.0.1

** Add utility functions stringprep_locale_charset(), stringprep_convert() 
and stringprep_locale_to_utf8 () that can be used to convert text from
system's locale into UTF-8, which should be done before invoking
stringprep().  The functions requires iconv() in the operating system.

** An example program (example.c) that illustrates how libstringprep can be
used is included.

** The pkg-config --libs output should now include necessary -R options.

* Version 0.0.0

** Initial release
