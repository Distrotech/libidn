to existing `stringprep_unichar_to_utf8'.

clean up API. The old entry point is maintained for binary backwards
compatibility though.

** Bug fixes.

* Version 0.0.1

** Add utility functions stringprep_locale_charset(), stringprep_convert() 
and stringprep_locale_to_utf8 () that can be used to convert text from

stringprep().  The functions requires iconv() in the operating system.

** An example program (example.c) that illustrates how libstringprep can be
used is included.

** The pkg-config --libs output should now include necessary -R options.
