Subject: Libidn 1.18
<#part sign=pgpmime>

GNU Libidn is a fully documented implementation of the Stringprep,
Punycode and IDNA specifications.  Libidn's purpose is to encode and
decode internationalized domain names.  The native C, C# and Java
libraries are available under the GNU Lesser General Public License
version 2.1 or later.

NEWS entries:

* Version 1.18 (released 2010-02-15) [stable]

** libidn: Put forgotten symbols under old namespace.
Reverts one unnecessary change introduced in 1.17.  Suggested by Marco
d'Itri <md@linux.it>.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

* Version 1.17 (released 2010-02-05) [alpha]

** libidn: Fix symbol export problem for a few variables.
Applications (that use these rarely used variables) built against
versions before 1.13 did not work with libidn versions 1.13 to 1.16.

Symbol versioning was introduced in version 1.13 but by accident some
symbols that were visible before that release were not exported, and
the consequence was that those symbols were not available in version
1.13 to 1.16.  This release fixes the problem, so the symbols are
visible again, making this release backwards compatible with all
earlier releases.

The affected symbols are the following variables:
stringprep_iscsi_prohibit, stringprep_rfc3454_A_1,
stringprep_rfc3454_B_1, stringprep_rfc3454_B_2,
stringprep_rfc3454_B_3, stringprep_rfc3454_C_1_1,
stringprep_rfc3454_C_1_2, stringprep_rfc3454_C_2_1,
stringprep_rfc3454_C_2_2, stringprep_rfc3454_C_3,
stringprep_rfc3454_C_4, stringprep_rfc3454_C_5,
stringprep_rfc3454_C_6, stringprep_rfc3454_C_7,
stringprep_rfc3454_C_8, stringprep_rfc3454_C_9,
stringprep_rfc3454_D_1, stringprep_rfc3454_D_2,
stringprep_saslprep_space_map.

Thanks to Marco d'Itri <md@linux.it> for reporting
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=561291> that led to
discovering this problem.

** Really fix the link error of self-tests on MinGW.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

The library contains a generic Stringprep implementation.  Profiles for
Nameprep, iSCSI, SASL, XMPP and Kerberos V5 are included.  Punycode and
ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) via IDNA are supported.  A mechanism to
define Top-Level Domain (TLD) specific validation tables, and to compare
strings against those tables, is included.  Default tables for some TLDs
are also included.

Libidn is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20 Unix
platforms (including Solaris, IRIX, AIX, and Tru64) and Windows.  The
library is written in C and (parts of) the API is also accessible from
C++, Emacs Lisp, Python and Java.  A native Java and C# port is
included.

Also included is a command line tool, several self tests, code examples,
and more, all licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.0
or later.

Improving Libidn is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find Libidn useful and wish to contribute back.  You
can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate money
or equipment.

Commercial support contracts for Libidn are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding Libidn
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See http://josefsson.org/ for more details.
