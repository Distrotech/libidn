Subject: Libidn 1.25 released
<#part sign=pgpmime>
GNU Libidn is a fully documented implementation of the Stringprep,
Punycode and IDNA specifications.  Libidn's purpose is to encode and
decode internationalized domain name strings.  There are native C, C#
and Java libraries.

Noteworthy changes since the last release (from NEWS file):

* Version 1.25 (released 2012-05-23) [stable]

** MSVC: Build fixes related to _GL_ATTRIBUTE_CONST and _GL_ATTRIBUTE_PURE.
Reported by Bartosz Brachaczek <b.brachaczek@gmail.com>.

** examples: Fix compiler warning about ignoring return value from fgets.

** tests: Ship with a valgrind suppressions file for the strlen issue.
See tests/libidn.supp and  bottom of HACKING for discussion.

** Update gnulib files and translations.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

The C library contains a generic Stringprep implementation.  Profiles
for Nameprep, iSCSI, SASL, XMPP and Kerberos V5 are included.
Punycode and ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) via IDNA are supported.
A mechanism to define Top-Level Domain (TLD) specific validation
tables, and to compare strings against those tables, is included.
Default tables for some TLDs are also included.

The Stringprep API consists of two main functions, one for converting
data from the system's native representation into UTF-8, and one
function to perform the Stringprep processing.  Adding a new
Stringprep profile for your application within the API is
straightforward.  The Punycode API consists of one encoding function
and one decoding function.  The IDNA API consists of the ToASCII and
ToUnicode functions, as well as an high-level interface for converting
entire domain names to and from the ACE encoded form.  The TLD API
consists of one set of functions to extract the TLD name from a domain
string, one set of functions to locate the proper TLD table to use
based on the TLD name, and core functions to validate a string against
a TLD table, and some utility wrappers to perform all the steps in one
call.

Libidn is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20 Unix
platforms (including Solaris, IRIX, AIX, and Tru64) and Windows.  The
library is written in C and (parts of) the API is also accessible from
C++, Emacs Lisp, Python and Java.  A native Java and C# port is
included.

Also included is a command line tool, several self tests, code
examples, and more.

Improving Libidn is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find Libidn useful and wish to contribute back.
You can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate
money or equipment.

Commercial support contracts for Libidn are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding Libidn
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See http://josefsson.org/ for more details.
