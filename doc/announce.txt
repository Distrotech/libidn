Subject: Libidn 1.21 released
<#part sign=pgpmime>
GNU Libidn is a fully documented implementation of the Stringprep,
Punycode and IDNA specifications.  Libidn's purpose is to encode and
decode internationalized domain names.  The native C, C# and Java
libraries are available under the GNU Lesser General Public License
version 2.1 or later.

Noteworthy changes since the last release (from NEWS file):

* Version 1.21 (released 2011-04-24) [stable]

** build/gettext: Demand gettext >= 0.18.1 in order to get newer M4 files.
The old M4 files associated with 0.17 caused problems on Solaris,
hopefully now fixed.  Reported by Dagobert Michelsen <dam@opencsw.org>
in <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.gnulib.bugs/25522>.

** build: Improve MinGW cross-compile makefile, see win32/libidn4win.mk.

** build: Visual Studio files fixed to define LIBIDN_BUILDING.
Tiny patch from Waqas Hussain <waqas20@gmail.com>.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.

The library contains a generic Stringprep implementation.  Profiles
for Nameprep, iSCSI, SASL, XMPP and Kerberos V5 are included.
Punycode and ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) via IDNA are supported.
A mechanism to define Top-Level Domain (TLD) specific validation
tables, and to compare strings against those tables, is included.
Default tables for some TLDs are also included.

Libidn is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20 Unix
platforms (including Solaris, IRIX, AIX, and Tru64) and Windows.  The
library is written in C and (parts of) the API is also accessible from
C++, Emacs Lisp, Python and Java.  A native Java and C# port is
included.

Also included is a command line tool, several self tests, code
examples, and more, all licensed under the GNU General Public License
version 3.0 or later.

Improving Libidn is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find Libidn useful and wish to contribute back.
You can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate
money or equipment.

Commercial support contracts for Libidn are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding Libidn
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See http://josefsson.org/ for more details.
