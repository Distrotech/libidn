See the end for copying conditions.

In "defs" create a directory for each top level domain, for which
you want a domain restriction structure compiled into the library.

Each of these directories must contains a file called "def", detailing the
unicode values of the legal EXTRA characters (i.e. not a-z0-9.-, that's
handled internally) AFTER nameprep (e.g. only include lowercase characters
or comparable local equivalents, see RFC3491). If definitions are shared
among several TLDs or are constructed from standard unicode blocks,
putting the building blocks in the directory templates and linking to
them via the command "#include @templates:filename_from_templates"
is probably a good idea.

Two mandatory lines must appear in a "def":

#source SOURCE_OF_INFORMATION
#version MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION

e.g.:

#source http://gnu.org/dot.gnu.idntables.html
#version 3.1415

Character codes may be specified as single numbers (like 123, 0xff, 0100)
or inclusive intervals (112-344 0xff-0100) using the usual C decimal, octal
or hex notations.
