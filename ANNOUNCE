Libidn ANNOUNCE -- Overview to attract interest.
See the end for copying conditions.

Libidn is an implementation of the Stringprep (Nameprep profile),
Punycode and IDNA specifications defined by the IETF Internationalized
Domain Names working group to implement internationalized domain
names.  It is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The library contains a generic Stringprep implementation (including
Unicode 3.2 NFKC normalization, table mapping of characters, and
Bidirectional Character handling), two Stringprep profiles; Nameprep
(for IDN) and Kerberos5, as well as a Punycode and IDNA.

The Stringprep API consists of two main functions, one for converting
data from the system's native representation into UTF-8, and one
function to perform the Stringprep processing.  Each stringprep
profile has a corresponding CPP macro.  Adding a new Stringprep
profile for your application within the API is straightforward.  The
Punycode API consists of one encoding function and one decoding
function.  The IDNA API consists of the ToASCII and ToUnicode
functions.

The library is currently used by forthcoming SASL and Kerberos
libraries to process user names and passwords before they are input to
cryptographic operations.  It is also used by experimental code for
domain name related purposes.

Libidn is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20 Unix
platforms (including Solaris, IRIX, AIX, and Tru64) and Windows.
