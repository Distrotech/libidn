Libidn README-alpha -- Important introductory notes for alpha releases.
See the end for copying conditions.

Libidn is unstable.  You should expect it to not work.  You should
expect it to have security problems.  The API will likely change.
This is the development release.  A proper release will be made in due
time.  Let me repeat that, LIBIDN IS MOST LIKELY INSECURE. DO NOT USE
IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!
