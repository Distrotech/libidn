Libidn README-alpha -- Important introductory notes for alpha releases.
See the end for copying conditions.

Libidn is unstable.  You should expect it to not work.  You should
expect it to have security problems.  The API will likely change.
This is the development release.  A proper release will be made in due
time.  Let me repeat that, LIBIDN IS MOST LIKELY INSECURE. DO NOT USE
IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!

The code will go through a security review before the stable release
is made.  Volunteers needed.  The alpha release has been written for
functionality, not security, as is painfully obvious.  It is hoped
that since this library is small it can be rewritten securely
in-place.
