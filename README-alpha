Libidn README-alpha -- Important introductory notes for alpha releases.

See the end for copying conditions.

Libidn is unstable.  You should expect it to not work.  You should
expect it to have security problems.  The API will likely change.
This is the development release.  A proper release will be made in due
time.  Let me repeat that, LIBIDN IS MOST LIKELY INSECURE. DO NOT USE
IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!

The code will go through a security review before the stable release
is made.  Volunteers and/or donations needed.  The alpha release has
been written for functionality, not security, as is painfully obvious.
It is hoped that since this library is small it can be rewritten
securely in-place.

It will not become stable without help.  Donate time or money.

To compile from CVS, you may need recent versions of perl, texinfo (>=
4.7), gengetopt (>= 2.13), cvs2cl, help2man, autoconf (>= 2.59),
automake (>= 1.9), libtool (>= 1.5.2), gtk-doc [1], doxygen, gcj,
gjdoc, and gettext (>= 0.14.1).

Bootstrap the build environment using:

  $ ./autogen.sh

Then run ./configure and make as usual.

[1] Apply the patch in
<http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156643> against GTK-DOC to
avoid initial build errors like this:

make[4]: *** No rule to make target `tmpl/*.sgml', needed by `sgml-build.stamp'.  Stop.
